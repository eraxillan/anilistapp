/**
 * Airing anime database CRUD: create-read-update-delete
 *
 * LiveData objects can be observed by another object.
 * LiveData notifies any observers when the data changes.
 * This provides a great way to keep user interface elements up
 * to date when items change in the database.
 * LiveData objects do their work in a background thread. By default, Room wonâ€™t
 * allow you to make calls to DAO methods on the main thread. By returning LiveData
 * objects, your method becomes an asynchronous query, and there is no restriction to
 * calling it from the main thread.
